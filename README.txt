This application takes an employee's annual salary figure and the relevant superannuation rate with the Australian government and constructs a paystub for any given pay period.

In order to operate the generator, you must provide the employee's first and last name, salary amount per year, super rate (which can be listed in either decimal or percent form) and the beginning and end dates of the pay period. 

After doing so, the application will display the information you have inputted, and ask you to confirm it as the correct data. If the data is incorrect, merely click the "No" button and you will be returned to the starting screen.

If you click the "Yes" button at the confirmation screen, a readout showing the gross income, income tax, net income, and super amount for the listed employee for the given pay period will be displayed.

As an example, you can input the information for an employee named "Phineas Gage," who makes $50,000 per year with a super rate of 9%, and ask the generator to put together a paystub for the pay period of May 1, 2015 to June 15, 2015.

The resulting output will give you a gross income of $6250, an income tax of $974.63, a net income of $5275.37, and a super amount of $562.50.
